# Cutwallpaper
A simple script to cut wallpapers in3/4 with a simple right click
As far as I know you can put the .desktop file in ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/ if you're on Plasma 5
Don't forget to edit the commented lines if you want it to work as you wish.

The right-click function does not seem to work when there is a space in the path. Yet.

Don't forget to set the right paths/resolutions in them
